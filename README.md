# About

- It's a chat interface.
- You type your nickname before you enter the chat room.
- Two clients can't have the same nickname at tha same time.
- You can send and recieve messages since you enter the room.
- You can see other users online.
- You can send and recieve private messages from other users.

I build this project because I was curious about how the chat rooms are made.

In the future I am willing to implent a login and sign up sistem.
